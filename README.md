# Final_Task_Solution (Project Name - Retail Business Performance & Profitability Analysis)
####  Objective
Analyze sales and profit data to uncover underperforming product categories, low-margin segments, and regional sales trends.

####  Tools Used
- Power BI (DAX for calculated fields)
- CSV Dataset (`SampleSuperstore.csv`)

#### Dashboard Features
- **Profit by Category** (Bar chart)
- **Profit Margin by Sub-Category** (Calculated field)
- **Monthly Sales Trends** (Line chart)
- **Profit by Region & Segment** (Stacked columns)
- **Treemap by Sub-Category** (Sales volume)
- **Interactive Filters**: Region, Segment, Category

#### Key Insights
- Tables and Bookcases have high sales but low profitability
- West region + Consumer segment generates highest profit
- Phones dominate overall revenue





# Final_Task_Solution (Project Name - HR Analytics – Predicting Employee Attrition)

####  Objective
This project analyzes HR data to identify key drivers of employee attrition and visualize patterns to support decision-making for improving employee retention.

#### Dataset
- IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset (`WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv`)
- Source: Kaggle

####  Tools Used
- Power BI (Dashboard)
- Python (Pandas, Sklearn, SHAP)
- CSV Export

####  Project Workflow
1. Data cleaning and encoding in Python
2. Logistic Regression modeling with scaling
3. SHAP explainability to highlight key attrition factors
4. Exported cleaned data to CSV for Power BI
5. Built interactive visuals and filters in Power BI

####  Power BI Visuals
- Attrition by Department
- Income vs Attrition
- Overtime vs Attrition
- Job Role vs Attrition
- Attrition by Age Group
- JobSatisfaction vs Attrition
- Heatmap: Department × Overtime
- Gender × Education Field vs Attrition
- KPI Cards: Attrition Rate
- Slicers: Gender, Age Group, Department

####  Key Insights
- Employees working overtime are far more likely to leave
- Low job satisfaction directly correlates with higher attrition
- Younger, low-income employees are at greater risk
- Sales and HR have significantly higher attrition compared to R&D

####  Conclusion
This project combines Python modeling and Power BI visualization to offer actionable insights into attrition, helping HR teams target retention strategies.
